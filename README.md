# gifsearch

Using me is very easy. Enter a search subject and hit 'Giphy It!'.

The app will return 10 gifs from Giphy API.
The gifs will animate when you click them, and pause when you click them again.

If you double click a gif it will get added to the big carousel at the bottom and your 'fav' cookie.
Opening the page will automatically load your fav gifs from your cookies.

Every unqiue search is turned into a button and stored in FireBase.
When you load up the page, it will show you all of the unique searches as buttons.

Clicking the button will run that Giphy search.

The page should be mobile responsive and play nice with your phones.
